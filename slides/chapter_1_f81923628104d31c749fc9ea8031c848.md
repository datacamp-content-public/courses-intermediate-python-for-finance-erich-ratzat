Alright, now that we know how to calculate daily returns it's time to go deeper.
In this lesson we will learn how to calculate the cumulative return of a stock. This is an important metric used primarily to compare the performance of different assets over time.

`@script`
If we plot both stocks prices on the same graph it is impossible to get any insights. It is very difficult to tell which stock most appreciated in the period. This is because stock prices have different scales.
To solve this problem we must normalize the data. And for that we will calculate the returns of the stocks that we have already learned in previous lectures.
