First let's take a look at the evolution of Amazon and Microsoft prices during the year of 2018.
The list shows amazon stock prices from the last day of December 2017 to the last day of December 2018.
When we plot this values on a graph we get this…
Amazon stock price went from $1186.1 to $1478.02.

`@script`
Now lets do the same for Microsoft stock price.
It seems Microsoft jumped from $83.42 to 99.59 on the same period.

## Stock prices in the same graph

`@script`
If we plot both stocks prices on the same graph it is impossible to get any insights. It is very difficult to tell which stock most appreciated in the period. This is because stock prices have different scales.
To solve this problem we must normalize the data. And for that we will calculate the returns of the stocks that we have already learned in previous lectures.

## Daily Stock Returns

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "045d911e01"
hide_title: false
```

`@part1`
&nbsp;
- A simple formula:{{1}}

`@script`
We know that the daily return is calculated by the formula : price of today divided by price of yesterday minus 1.

## Annual Stock Returns

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "488aea48ee"
```

`@part1`
- The same formula:

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5053/datasets/d6349cd38144ee91f34bd7131c0b137473a01157/price_annual.PNG.png){{2}}


`@part2`
```
In [1]: (amazon_price[-1] / amazon_price[0]) -1
Out[1]: 0.2461
```


```
In [2]: (msft_price[-1] / msft_price[0]) -1
Out[2]: 0.1939
```


`@script`
And what about the annual return? The logic here is the same, however we will have as price of today the last price of the year 2018 and for yesterday price the last price of the year 2017.
Great! Now it is easy to know which stock performed better in the period: We know that Amazon returned 24.61% in 2018 while Microsoft returned 19.39% in the same period.
But is there a more visual way to identify this? Certainly!

## cumprod()

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "5c01b673a0"
```

`@part1`
- first calculate daily returns:
```
amzn_ret = amzn.pct_change()
```{{1}}

- then add 1:{{2}}
```
amzn_ret_index = amzn_ret + 1
```{{3}}


`@part2`
- finally call the cumprod() method:
```
cumulative_ret = amzn_ret_index.cumprod()
```


`@script`
We can visually compare both stocks plotting the evolution of accumulated returns in the analyzed period. For this we will first calculate the daily returns, then we will add 1 for the returns and finally use the cumprod() method from pandas. This method returns a DataFrame or Series of the same size containing the cumulative product.

## cumprod()

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "8a1147b17e"
```

`@part1`
```
stocks_ret_cum.plot(title='Stock Returns Comparison')
plt.show()
```{{1}}

`@script`
When plotting the cumulative return day after day you will get the following graph:
A picture is worth a thousand words! We can easily identify that Amazon presented better return than Microsoft! It is possible to see that Amazon had a much higher return during almost the entire year but in the last quarter the stock lost breath and the return of both was pretty close in December. It was just on the year-end that Amazon presented better returns than Microsoft.

Now it's time to practice what you've learned here! Good Luck!
